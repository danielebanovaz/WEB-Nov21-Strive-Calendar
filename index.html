        --------------------- COLLECTING CALENDAR'S FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS ---------------------  -> ANALYSIS
        
        - show the days of the displayed month
        - user can select a day (it will be highlighted, and related meetings will be displayed)
        - provide some ways to collect user input about new meetings to be created
        - meeting details should include meeting time and meeting description
        - create new meetings based on the user input
        - display assigned meetings related to the selected day (and even clear the list if no meeting is present)
        - the days should be grouped in 7-days rows
        - we want a title for each section (month/meeting creation/assigned meetings)

        -- NICE TO HAVE:
        - we want to persist our meeting data in order to not to lose it when we refresh the page
        - we want the days to be created based on the actual current month
        - we want the current day to be the selected one when we load the page
        - the current day should be easily recognizable
        - display the name of the month
        - highlight the day I'm hovering
        - show weekday names
        - display days that have any assigned meeting in a different way
        - being able to color days differently based on user choices
        - being able to color meetings differently based on user choices
        - our layout should be responsive (= behave correctly on mobile as well)
        - being able to select multiple days and add meetings to all of them
        - being able to delete/modify an exiting meeting



        --------------------- LIST ALL THE THINGS WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT ---------------------  -> DESIGN

        --- HTML ELEMENTS
        - a title for the calendar page
        - a container for the days of the month
        -- days of the month
        - a container for the user input controls
        -- meeting time input
        -- meeting description input
        -- meeting creation button
        -- selected day label
        - headers for each section
        - a container (or list) to display all meetings related to the selected day

        --- CSS STYLES
        - inputs
        - month
        - headers
        - generic day
        - selected day
        - meetings
        

        --- JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS
        - select a day (when the user clicks on that)
        - programmatically create days in the month
        - read the user input and create a new meeting accordingly
        - display meetings for the currently selected day
        - save newly created meetings data in a structured way
        - retrieve all meetings related to a specific day
        
        -- NICE TO HAVE:
        - persist created meetings on the disk, and load them as soon as we load the page
